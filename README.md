# BreakOutGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

An old classic made on Unreal just as an introduction to it. 
Controls: Space to launch and left/right to control paddle.

The audio effects implemented are through the Modular Synth System.
Will try and create a full sountrack in the engine using just that and Time Synth
